The success of transfer learning from unsupervised models has allowed us to surpass virtually all existing benchmarks on downstream supervised learning tasks.

        "Traditionally, zero-shot learning (ZSL) most often referred to a fairly specific type of task: learn a classifier on one set of labels and then evaluate on a different set of labels that the classifier has never seen before. Recently, especially in NLP, it's been used much more broadly to mean _get a model to do something that it wasn't explicitly trained to do._ A well-known example of this is in the [GPT-2 paper](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9405/cc0d6169988371b2755e573cc28650d14dfe.pdf) where the authors evaluate a language model on downstream tasks like machine translation without fine-tuning on these tasks directly. \n",
        "\n",
        "The definition is not all that important, but it is useful to understand that the term is used in various ways and that we should therefore take care to understand the experimental setting when comparing different methods. For example, traditional zero-shot learning requires providing some kind of descriptor ([Romera-Paredes et al. 2015](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v37/romera-paredes15.pdf)) for an unseen class (such as a set of visual attributes or simply the class name) in order for a model to be able to predict that class without training data. Understanding that different zero-shot methods may adopt different rules for what kind of class descriptors are allowed provides relevant context when communicating about these techniques."

They can then take some training set and use only a subset of the available labels to learn a linear projection to align the image and label embeddings. At test time, this framework allows one to embed any label (seen or unseen) and any image into the same latent space and measure their distance."

In this paper, the authors reformulate text classification as a cloze task. A cloze question considers a sequence which is partially masked and requires predicting the missing value(s) from the context. PET requires a human practitioner to construct several task-appropriate cloze-style templates which, in the case of topic classification, could look something like the following:"

In addition, the authors introduce a sort of knowledge distilation procedure. After generating a set of predictions from the cloze task, these predicted values are used as _proxy labels_ on which a new classifier is trained from scratch. My intuition is that this step is effective because it allows us to do inference over the whole test set collectively, allowing the model to learn from the set over which it is predicting rather than treating each test point independently. I suspect that this step would be particularly helpful when adapting to novel domains which do not resemble the MLM's training corpus."

Although PET significantly outperforms the other methods described here, it also makes use of data which the other approaches do not assume access to: multiple task-specific, hand-crafted cloze sentences and a large set of unlabeled data for the distilation/self-learning step. I say this not to knock PET by any means, nor do the authors compare themselves to the methods I've outlined here, but simply to emphasize the importance of taking care in comparing different approaches which can all be considered, in some sense, \"zero-shot\"."
